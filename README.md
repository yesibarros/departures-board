# Departures-board-CAVU

## Description
The present project builds a flights departure dashboard by consuming a flights data API. It speeds up the consumption and updating of flights information, which is a task that must be carried out with the greatest speed and precision possible, given the accelerated context that is that of airports.

I really enjoyed developing this project and I'm very proud of it as it is my very first Vue.JS project. It was a very nice challenge to my frontend development skills, it allowed me to discover Vue.JS V2 (and fall in love with it) and start learning it from scratch, that was one of the reasons for which I decided not to use any material design components. This motivates me to keep growing as a developer, to keep on learning and continue doing this, which is something I really enjoy and ignites a fire in me.
